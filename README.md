# DontTouchIt
Is an inductive distance sensor board based on the TI LDC1614 chip.

It is intended for 3d Printers to measure the distance to the printing bed.
It speeds up quad gantry levelling and bed mesh calibration as no z movement is needed to get the distance between the probe and the bed.

As it supports three sensors it could probably be used also for homing.

## Klipper 3D support
I added experimental support to klipper and the following video shows a Quad Gantry Level run
